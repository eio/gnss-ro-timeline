"2019","Spire and the Luxembourg Space Agency announce their plans to create a data lake of Earth observation data - including GNSS-RO data from Spire satellites - which will be open to any startup, research institute or public agency in Luxembourg.","https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5d25fc2834a5c400084aef30/960x0.jpg",1,0
"2019","Spire Global unveils Spire Forecast on September 11, the first product from the Spire Weather business unit. With 5000 radio occultation profiles collected by Spire's satellites each day, the product provides maritime clients with detailed information on atmospheric conditions including global sea surface temperatures, ocean currents, wave heights, surface winds and air temperature.","https://weather.spire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-22-at-5.22.52-PM.png",2,0,
"2019","Spire's global weather model is enhanced by a steadily growing constellation of satellites, each equipped with their own GNSS Radio Occultation payload. Adding to what is already one of the largest private constellations in the world, the company exceeds 100 successfully deployed satellites early in the year.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Spire_Glasgow_Cleanroom_2017.jpg/400px-Spire_Glasgow_Cleanroom_2017.jpg",3,0
"2018-2017","The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) awards contracts to 3 satellite companies for Round Two of the CWDP. NOAA plans to review space-based RO data from Spire, GeoOptics, and PlanetIQ in order to determine its quality and potential value to NOAA’s weather forecasts and warnings.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Spire_Weather_2019.png/800px-Spire_Weather_2019.png",4,0

"1995","GPS/MET, proposed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), is remarkably successful in measuring properties of the atmosphere and ionosphere with a low-cost and reliable instrument.","https://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/cb/50/cb5032fe-cf64-4a3e-8cb0-fff64372c367/gnss-ro-diagram.png__800x453_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.png",11,0
"1988","JPL submits the first GPS occultation proposal to NASA. Although the “GPS Geoscience Instrument” does not fly, the concept is established, and development of GPS remote sensing technology begins. NASA starts developing GPS remote sensing receivers, and global ground networks are put in place.","https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/control/map.png",12,0
"1980s","As the Global Positioning System (GPS) emerges, NASA devises new analysis techniques and equipment. The quest for sub-centimeter global accuracy soon leads to GPS-derived measurements of the atmosphere and ionosphere. Texas Instruments begins selling its TI 4100 NAVSTAR Navigator, the first commercial GPS receiver.","https://www.ion.org/museum/photos/TI%204100%20and%20Antenna%20NOAA-NGS.JPG",13,0
