2020,"In January, the US House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology approves legislation to coordinate federal government space weather research, forecasting, and operations with input from academia, commercial firms, and other groups affected by space weather. The new bipartisan legislation, Promoting Research and Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow (PROSWIFT) Act, enables NOAA to establish a pilot program awarding contracts to commercial space weather companies. In Europe, the Airbus and UK-built Solar Orbiter is readied for its February launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.",https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rsz_space_weather-879x485.jpg,1,0
2019,"The UK's Strategic Priorities Fund announces £20 million pounds of new funding to the country's national weather service, the Meteorological Office, originally founded in 1854. The Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre (MOSWOC) aims to produce practical solutions such as forecasting to reduce the impact of space weather on mobile phones, transport, GPS signals and electricity networks. The same year, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee of the US Senate approves the Space Weather Research and Forecasting Act.",https://images.slideplayer.com/39/10962456/slides/slide_3.jpg,2,0

2010-2012,"The US National Space Weather Program revises its strategic plan in 2010. More revisions continue throughout 2011 and 2012, as interest in space weather stabilizes and solidifies. European interest is also maintained as ESA holds the 7th, 8th, and 9th annual European Space Weather Weeks at ESTEC in Noordwijk.",http://www.stce.be/esww9/images/postercut.png,5,0
2007,"NOAA's space weather program refocuses on its most unique and economically important aspect: operational space weather alerts, watches, and warnings. Implementation begins when the Space Environment Center (SEC) is formally transferred into the National Weather Service (NWS). In 2007, the SEC is renamed the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) to better reflect its new operational mission. NOAA and the NSF also hold a workshop this year to discuss the use of small satellites for space weather research.","https://image2.slideserve.com/3890716/space-weather-measurements-capabilities-and-needs-n.jpg",6,0
2001-2004,"ESA continues its trend of official space weather workshops at ESTEC. In 2001 the event is called ""Looking Towards a Future European Space Weather Programme"". In 2002 they introduce the ""Space Weather Applications Pilot Project"". And in 2003 the focus is ""Developing a European Space Weather Service Network"". Following these successful workshops, ESA organizes the ""First European Space Weather Week"" on December 3rd of 2004, and continues to hold the event annually for every year after to develop an expertise space situational awareness.",http://swe.ssa.esa.int/SRV/ssa_space_weather_service_network.jpg,7,0
2000,"The US National Space Weather Program creates an official action plan for focusing research on the needs of commercial and government entities affected by space weather. This action plan will continue to grow and evolve in the following years. Around the same time, ESA congregates at ESTEC once again for a ""Workshop on The Utilization of a Future European Space Weather Service"".","http://swe.ssa.esa.int/TECEES/spweather/workshops/proceedings_w2/conflogoeuro.jpg",8,0
1998,"The European Space Agency (ESA) holds a Workshop on Space Weather at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, Netherlands. It acknowledges that ""European Space Weather activities are fragmented in different groups and European-wide initiatives are in an embryonic state"". Additionally, it recognizes the need for ""input from potential users of future Space Weather services"" and sets the goal of generating a ""global picture"" of all issues concerning space weather.",http://swe.ssa.esa.int/TECEES/spweather/workshops/proceedings_w1/98c19.gif,9,0
1992-1994,"In 1992, dual‐frequency radio observations become available as a method for deriving TEC using the Global Positioning System (GPS) network. Dual‐frequency receivers can use signals of two different frequencies to remove positioning errors from calculations, greatly improving the quality of observations. Due to an increase in public and government attention, the multi-agency US National Space Weather Program is created in 1994.",https://image3.slideserve.com/5458953/slide14-l.jpg,10,0
1970s,"By the 1970s, the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory has been integrated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite declining resources, the renamed Space Environment Laboratory (SEL) - later the Space Environment Center (SEC) - continues to maintain and advocate a complete end-to-end space weather program.",https://www.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/INFOGRAPHIC-space-weather-NOAA-061716-2550x1650-original.jpg,11,0
1950s-1960s,"The morphological classification of ionospheric storms is enhanced by new observational data such as Total Electron Content (TEC), which can be simply thought of as the total number of electrons in a straight line between a satellite and the ground. Using artificial satellites to investigate the ionosphere is proposed as a method 1956, demonstrated in 1959 with initial measurements, and finally employed in the 1960s to better understand the basic mechanisms of ionospheric storms.

1950s,"Research on the response of the ionosphere to geomagnetic activity is bolstered by increasingly large-scale studies, some of which have collected electron density observations over the course of up to 10 years  [Matsushita 1959]. Early simulations and statistical treatment of perturbation data help demonstrate that there are common elements to all ionospheric storms, and the term ""space weather"" is used for the first time.",https://cdn.britannica.com/46/109746-050-9511BBEF/differences-layers-ionosphere-Earth.jpg,13,0
1940s,"The Interservice Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) is formed in the early 1940s to deliver high-frequency radio blackout forecasts for the Allied Forces. It later becomes the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory, transfers from Washington to Boulder, and carries out space environment monitoring, modeling, forecasting, and basic solar-terrestrial research.",https://archive.org/services/img/basicradiopropag48inte,14,0
1800s,"The first-observed solar flare coincides with the largest geomagnetic storm on record, later referred to as ""the Carrington Event"", which occurs in early September of 1859 when a solar Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) hits the Earth's magnetosphere. The first known forecast of severe electrical currents on Earth due to solar activity is provided by William Ellis offered in 1879, when he warns that sensitive telegraphic equipment might react to an upcoming increase in solar activity.",https://icravescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SolarSuperstorm.jpg,15,0
