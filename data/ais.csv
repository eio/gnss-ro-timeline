"2019","Spire and the Luxembourg Space Agency announce their plans to create a data lake of Earth observation data - including AIS data from Spire satellites - which will be open to any startup, research institute or public agency in Luxembourg.","https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5d25fc2834a5c400084aef30/960x0.jpg",1,0
"2017","Spire Maritime releases an API that delivers satellite AIS data enhanced with machine learning (Vessels and Predict) backed by its 40+ constellation of nano-satellites.","",2,0
"2014","All EU fishing boats over 15m must have a Class A by May of this year.,","",3,0
"2013","Aalborg University launches AAUSAT3, a 1U cubesat weighing 800 grams, developed solely by students from the Department of Electronic Systems. Proposed and sponsored by the Danish Maritime Safety Administration, the satellite carries two AIS receivers — a traditional and a SDR-based receiver - and has been a huge success. The total cost including launch was less than €200,000.","",4,0
"2012","Spire Global - originally called NanoSatisfi Inc. - is founded in San Francisco, California. It begins as part of ArduSat, a project aiming to 'democratize access to space'.","https://fresco.vc/wp-content/uploads/spire-5.png",5,0
"2011","The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched the Resourcesat-2 satellite containing an AIS payload for monitoring maritime traffic in the Indian Ocean Search & Rescue (SAR) zone. AIS data is processed at National Remote Sensing Centre and archived at Indian Space Science Data Centre.","",6,0
"2010","Most commercial vessels operating on the European Inland Waterways are required to fit an Inland waterway certified Class A AIS system. In May, the European Space Agency begins testing an AIS receiver from Kongsberg Seatex (Norway) in a consortium led by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment to demonstrate space-based ship monitoring. This is a first step towards a satellite-based AIS-monitoring service.","",7,0
"2009","NASA's STS-129 space shuttle mission attaches two antennas - an AIS VHF antenna, and an Amateur Radio antenna - to the Columbus module of the International Space Station. Both antennas are built in cooperation between ESA and the ARISS team (Amateur Radio on ISS).","",8,0
"2008","Companies such as exactEarth, ORBCOMM, Spacequest, and Spire Global - along with various government programs - begin deploying AIS receivers on satellites.","",9,0
"2006","The AIS standards committee publishes the Class B type AIS transceiver specification, designed to enable a simpler and lower-cost AIS device. Low-cost Class B transceivers become available in the same year, triggering mandate adoptions by numerous countries and making large-scale installation of AIS devices on vessels of all sizes commercially viable.","",10,0
"2005","Various entities begin experimenting with detecting AIS transmissions using satellite-based receivers.","",11,0
"2002","The International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandates that all passenger ships (and other commercial vessels over 300 gross tonnage) should carry Class A AIS transceivers. This was decided at the IMO's International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). At the time this affected around 100,000 ships, but since then use has expanded as the unit cost of transceivers has fallen and adoption has increased.","",12,0

"2000","AIS is developed using a combination of other technologies including Very High Frequency (VHF) radio and SOTDMA. Companies in America and Sweden work towards making AIS a viable collision avoidance tool for large vessels.","",14,0
"1990","Self Organized Time Division Multiple Access (SOTDMA) is developed as a means for mobile devices to communicate with each other. Following imminent requirements from the International Maritime Organization (IMO), technical committees from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) begin to develop Automatic Identification System (AIS) technology standards.","",15,0
