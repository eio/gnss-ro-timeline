"2019","Spire Global announces the company's first product from its Spire Aviation division with the launch of their new AirSafe API. The AirSafe product uses ADS-B data collected from Spire's satellite constellation to solve the industry's need for flight tracking data covering both land and oceans at a competitive cost.","",1,0
"2018","Spire Global announces that its first ADS-B enabled satellites are due to launch by the end of Q3. Like all LEMUR2 class satellites, these first ADS-B satellites are multi-sensor, carrying additional weather (GPS-Radio Occultation) and maritime (Automatic Identification System) payloads.","",2,0
"2012","Spire Global - originally called NanoSatisfi Inc. - is founded in San Francisco, California. It begins as part of ArduSat, a project aiming to 'democratize access to space'.","https://fresco.vc/wp-content/uploads/spire-5.png",3,0
"2011","The FAA requests that the ARC provide a forum for the U.S. aviation community to define a strategy for incorporating ADS–B In technologies into the National Airspace System (NAS). In response, recommendations are provided that clearly define how the community should proceed with ADS–B In while ensuring compatibility with ADS–B Out avionics standards defined previously.","",4,0
"2010","Following the FAA's consideration of the ARC results in 2008, it publishes the final rule for ADS-B Out performance requirements. As a result, new regulations are added to existing ones and cover 'aircraft operating in Classes A, B, and C airspace, as well as certain other specified classes of airspace within the U.S.'","",5,0
"2007-2008","The FAA publishes its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for ADS-B Out on October 5, 2007.  Simultaneously, the FAA charters the ADS-B Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) to provide the aviation community with a forum for 'discussion and review' of the NPRM. On September 26, 2008, the ARC publishes its results.","",6,0
"2007","The Capstone Program in Alaska leads to the Universal Access Transceiver (UAT), a device that can communicate with both the ground and nearby aircraft to exchange ADS-B position data. UAT uses readily available components to keep costs down and can be incorporated into radios in smaller and lower-flying aircraft.","",7,0
"1990s","Radar surveillance of runways and taxiways is added, and surveillance accuracy at the surface becomes good enough to feed into the automatic safety warning devices. The FAA's Surveillance Vision Plan (Rev 2) was published.  The SVP describes a 'transition from ground-based radar surveillance to a joint satellite-based and ground-based surveillance system' in 5-year segments through 2015.","",8,0
"1980s","The Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) is developed as an international standard. It uses air-to-air surveillance and is required on all commercial aircraft operating in the US and Europe.","",9,0
"1981","The FAA announces a decision to implement an aircraft collision avoidance concept called the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The concept is based upon development efforts in the areas of beacon based collision avoidance systems and air-to-air discrete address communications.","",10,0
"1970s","The Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS), also known as Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR), is upgraded to enhance surveillance performance in dense airspace. It also improves transmissions between ground and aircraft. ","",11,0
"1960s","Long range radars are deployed along primary air routes. Also added during this time are automatic aircraft tracking and weather tracking. Elements of the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system - which first emerged during World War II - are adapted into an FAA standard for civil aviation. This leads to transponders becoming increasingly mandatory for US aircraft.","",12,0
"1950s","GCA matures and is widely accepted through the mid-1950s, at which time the Instrument Landing System (ILS) begins replacing GCA.  Though ILS uses similar course guidance principles to GCA, ILS instrumentation on-board aircraft displays course deviation directly to the pilot.","",13,0
"1945","Civil aviation first uses GCA equipment at La Guardia Airport, where it is instrumental in tripling the landing rate to 15 planes per hour.","",14,0
"1943","Air traffic control (ATC) and radar are used together for the first time when Air Force air traffic controllers begin using Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) equipment to help military pilots land safely in poor visibility.","",15,0
