2020,"On January 2, Spire's new GNSS-R cubesats officially begin collecting data, with everything working well according to the GNSS Program Manager, Dallas Masters. Just a couple of weeks later, Spire shares early data from their GNSS-R satellites at the American Meteorological Society (AMS) conference in Boston, MA. The team releases an image of the Tibetan Plateau where the newest additions to their growing constellation have recently collected data.",https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Spire-GNSS-R-first-image.png,1,0
2019,"On December 11, Spire launches two GNSS Reflectometry cubesats from an Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. Equipped with bistatic radars to observe how GNSS signals scatter after bouncing off Earth surface features, the growing space company has ambitions to use the data across multiple verticals. Measuring soil moisture will bolster their agricultural data offerings, sensing sea ice depth will be relevant to their maritime customers, and potentially detecting tsunamis in real-time will help them tip off national emergency teams and early responders.",https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/rsz_spire_launch_history_-879x485.png,,
2019,"Spire's global weather model is enhanced by a steadily growing constellation of satellites, each equipped with their own GNSS Radio Occultation payload.

2017-2019,"In 2019, following their 2017 paper regarding ""Statistical Comparison and Combination of GPS, GLONASS, and Multi-GNSS Multipath Reflectometry Applied to Snow Depth Retrieval"", an international group of researchers publish a new paper on GNSS multipath reflectometry for soil moisture retrieval. Spanning 3 continents over the course of several years, their results indicate that a new algorithm can successfully retrieve near-surface soil moisture with correlation around 0.9 and an RMS error of less than 0.04 cm3/cm3. One of the research group's members, Prof. Tonie van Dam, is also on the teaching faculty for the University of Luxembourg's brand new Interdisciplinary Space Master program.",https://www.meinbergglobal.com/images/news/xsatellite-systems.jpg.pagespeed.ic.3KpEvdP0Pt.jpg,4,0
